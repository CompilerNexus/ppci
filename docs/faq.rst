*Why? WHY?!*

    There are several reasons:

    * it is possible!
    * this compiler is very portable due to python being portable.
    * writing a compiler is a very challenging task

*Is this compiler slower than compilers written in C/C++?*

    Yes. Although a comparison is not yet done, this will be the
    case, due to the overhead and slower execution of python code.

*Cool project, I want to contribute to this project, what can I do?*
