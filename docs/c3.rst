C3
==

Introduction
------------

As an example language, the c3 language was created. As pointed out clearly
c2lang_, the C language is widely used, but has some strange contraptions:

- The include file system. This results in lots of code duplication and file
creation.
- The comma statement: x = a(),2; assigns 2 to x.
- C is difficult to parse with a simple parser. The parser has to know what
a symbol is when it is parsed.
- Etc...

For these reasons (and of course, for fun), C3 was created.

Example
-------

The hello world example in c3:

.. code::

    module hello;
    import io;

    function void main()
    {
        io.println("Hello world");
    }

Modules
~~~~~~~

Modules in C3 live in file, and can be defined in multiple files. Modules can
import each other by using the import statement.
