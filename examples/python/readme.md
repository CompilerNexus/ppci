# Compile to python

It is possible to convert IR-code into python code. The python code is not
efficient, but it will work, and therefore it is a helpful aid when testing
the compiler.

# Compile python to native code

The inverse is also possible: compiling python to IR-code and next native
code. The performance.py script is an example of this.
