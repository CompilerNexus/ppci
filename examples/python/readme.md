# Compile to Python

It is possible to convert PPCI IR-code into python code. The Python code is not
efficient, but it will work, and therefore it is a helpful aid when testing
the compiler.

# Compile Python to native code

The inverse is also possible: compiling Python to IR-code and next native
code. The performance.py script is an example of this.
